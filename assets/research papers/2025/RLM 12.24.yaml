## Research Paper Analysis Summary  
**Paper:** Recursive Language Models  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.24601

| Category | S-NIAH (Scalable Needle-In-A-Haystack) | OOLONG | OOLONG-Pairs |
|--------|----------------------------------------|--------|--------------|
| What it Tests | Ability to find specific critical information hidden in extremely large documents | Reasoning across long documents where information is distributed across many sections | Cross-document reasoning over multiple long documents |
| Simple Explanation | Finding a small but important detail buried inside millions of tokens | Combining insights from multiple distant parts of a long report | Comparing or aggregating information from two very large documents |
| Why It Matters in Real World | Legal discovery, compliance checks, audit trails, investigative research | Policy interpretation, research synthesis, technical documentation | Contract comparison, regulatory alignment, M&A due diligence |
| Why RLMs Perform Well | RLMs programmatically search and narrow context instead of reading everything at once | RLMs recursively decompose documents and analyze relevant sections | RLMs process each document independently and then reason across results |

## 3️⃣ Use GitHub’s **Preview** tab (this is key)

When editing on GitHub:

1. Click the **Edit (✏️)** icon  
2. Click **Preview**  
3. You should see a clean table layout

If you still see raw `|` symbols → something is wrong (usually spacing or backticks).

## 4️⃣ Common formatting rules (quick checklist)

✔ One header row  
✔ One separator row with `---`  
✔ Same number of columns in every row  
✔ No extra spaces before or after `|` at line start  

Example of a **broken row**:
```markdown
